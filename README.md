Some scripts to generate scores (careful, they are brittle). Run this from the directory you want to work in.

Requirements:
Java (should be fine ... CRC)
conda (also should be fine ...CRC)

First, run ./get_tools.sh. This will create a directory bin, and get the scripts you need in it.

Second, run get_scores.sh  ... TODO: Nate, I need to understand how you want the inputs passed in
